🗣 Reported Speech – Mapa Visual

1. Preguntas (Questions)

🔹 Si empieza con Wh- (what, why, where…) → mantenemos esa palabra.
🔹 Si es Yes/No → usamos if / whether.
🔹 Cambiamos la pregunta a enunciado (sujeto + verbo).

Ejemplo:
	•	“Why is Dave mad at me?”
➡ She asked why Dave was mad at her.
	•	“Have I done something wrong?”
➡ She asked if/whether she had done something wrong.

⸻

2. Órdenes y peticiones (Commands & Requests)

🔹 Para órdenes → tell + objeto + to + verbo
🔹 Para peticiones → ask + objeto + to + verbo
🔹 “Don’t” → not to

Ejemplo:
	•	“Be quiet!”
➡ He told me to be quiet.
	•	“Please don’t interrupt me.”
➡ He asked me not to interrupt him.

3. Afirmaciones (Statements)

🔹 Usamos say (that) o tell (someone that).
🔹 Cambiamos pronombres y tiempos verbales.
🔹 El tiempo verbal retrocede un paso:

Direct Speech
Reported Speech
Present → “I am tired”
Past → He said (that) he was tired
Past → “I went home”
Past Perfect → He said (that) he had gone home
Will → “I will call”
Would → He said (that) he would call
Can → “I can help”
Could → He said (that) he could help
Must → “I must go”
Had to → He said (that) he had to go

⏳ También cambian expresiones de tiempo:
	•	today → that day
	•	yesterday → the previous day
	•	tomorrow → the next/following day
	•	next week → the following week

Ejemplo:
	•	“I want to listen to Sean’s songs.”
➡ Jay said (that) he wanted to listen to Sean’s songs.

⸻

📌 Idea principal:
Cuando reportamos lo que alguien dijo, retrocedemos el tiempo, cambiamos pronombres/tiempo y quitamos la forma de pregunta/imperativo → lo convertimos en enunciado.
