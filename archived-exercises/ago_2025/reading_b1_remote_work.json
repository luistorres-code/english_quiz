			"readingText": ["The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed how we think about work. Before 2020, remote work was considered a luxury available to only a few professionals. However, when lockdowns forced millions of employees to work from home, companies quickly discovered that productivity didn't necessarily decrease when people worked remotely.", "Recent surveys indicate that approximately 60% of employees now prefer a hybrid work model, combining both office and home-based work. This shift has prompted many organizations to reconsider their traditional office-centric policies. Companies are realizing that offering flexible work arrangements can help them attract and retain top talent, particularly among younger generations who prioritize work-life balance.", "Nevertheless, remote work isn't without its challenges. Communication can become more difficult when team members are scattered across different locations. Some employees struggle with isolation and miss the social aspects of office life. Additionally, not all jobs are suitable for remote work - healthcare workers, teachers, and manufacturing employees often need to be physically present to perform their duties effectively.", "Looking ahead, experts predict that the future workplace will be more flexible than ever before. Technology will continue to evolve, making virtual collaboration even more seamless. However, the most successful companies will likely be those that can balance the benefits of remote work with the advantages of in-person collaboration, creating a work environment that serves both business needs and employee preferences."],
