But, in the past, it wasn't always this easy.", "In the past, people had other ways of getting their messages across. For example, some used pigeons (known as messenger pigeons or carrier pigeons) while others used different animals. One of the most common ways was to use carrier pigeons.", "The ancient Egyptians and Persians were the first people to use carrier pigeons to send messages. They would attach a small message to the pigeon's leg in a tiny tube. The pigeon would then fly back to its home, delivering the message.", "This method was very reliable because pigeons have an excellent sense of direction and can find their way home from very long distances. During both World Wars, carrier pigeons played an important role in military communications. Many pigeons even received medals for their brave service!"],
