			"readingText": ["Sarah Martinez is absolutely exhausted after her first week at the new marketing firm. The management made it clear that employees must arrive by 8:30 AM sharp - no exceptions. 'You'd better not be late,' her supervisor warned on the first day, 'or you'll have to make up the time later.'", "The company culture is quite demanding. Workers have to do extensive research for each campaign, and they must make crucial decisions under huge pressure. Sarah's colleague, Mike, looks frustrated most of the time. 'I'd rather work freelance than deal with this stress,' he confided to Sarah during lunch. 'The salary is good, but my total income was actually higher when I was self-employed because of the additional projects I could take on.'", "Despite the challenges, Sarah is delighted with the learning opportunities. The organization provides excellent training, and the development programs are outstanding. 'You must be thrilled to work here,' said her friend Emma. 'Well,' Sarah replied, 'I need to work out a better work-life balance, but the experience is invaluable. I just need some advice on time management.'", "Looking at her schedule, Sarah realizes she can't keep working 12-hour days. She might have to chill out on weekends to avoid burnout. The company's success is huge, but employees must also take care of their well-being. As the HR manager explained, 'You don't have to sacrifice your health for your career - that's not what we expect here.'"],
