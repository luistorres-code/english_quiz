			"readingText": ["Emma is a 28-year-old teacher who lives in Manchester. Last spring, she decided to start a new hobby because she felt stressed from work and wanted to relax in her free time.", "She chose gardening because her grandmother had a beautiful garden when Emma was a child. Emma bought some basic tools: a shovel, gloves, and a watering can. She also purchased seeds for tomatoes, carrots, and flowers.", "At first, gardening was very difficult for Emma. She didn't know when to water the plants or how much sunlight they needed. Some of her first plants died because she gave them too much water. However, she didn't give up and decided to read books about gardening.", "Now, six months later, Emma has a lovely small garden behind her house. She grows fresh vegetables that she uses for cooking. Her tomatoes are red and delicious, and her flowers make her garden colorful and beautiful. Emma says gardening helps her feel calm and happy after a long day at school.", "Emma's friends are impressed with her garden. They often visit her on weekends to see her plants and eat fresh salads made with her vegetables. Emma is already planning to expand her garden next year and grow even more varieties of plants."],
